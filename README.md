# First and second level administrative divisions of Uzbekistan
The data that you cannot find in the official website of stat.uz ))  
I decided to open this repo to save and share the up-to-date data about regions and districts in Uzbekistan.  
Hope this would be helpful for programmers and anyone interested doing project about Uzbekistan.  
I will be adding more stuff in the future...
